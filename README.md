HNG Stage 0 – MyCard
A simple and elegant digital card that introduces me by showcasing my hobbies, interests, and dislikes.
Built as part of the HNG Internship Stage 0 task, focusing on clean design, semantic structure, and responsiveness.
This project highlights my ability to translate basic requirements into a visually appealing and functional interface.
It also reflects my attention to detail and my growing passion for building user-centered web experiences.
A solid start to my HNG journey and a foundation for upcoming stages.



HNG Stage 1 — About Me & Contact Pages

This project is part of the HNG Internship Stage 1 Challenge, an extension of my Stage 0 task (personal card). The goal of this stage was to transform a single-page project into a multi-page, responsive, and accessible web application.

The two key additions in this stage include:

About Me Page — a reflective page where I share my bio, goals, areas for improvement, and personal growth mindset.

Contact Page — a functional and accessible contact form with form validation, enabling users to reach out easily.

 Features

Semantic HTML: Clean, well-structured markup following accessibility best practices.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Form Validation: Ensures correct input with real-time error messages and success feedback.

Consistent Navigation: A global navbar links all pages seamlessly.

Accessible UI: Every form element is labeled and keyboard navigable.

 What I Learned

Building multi-page applications with consistent styling and navigation.

Implementing client-side form validation using JavaScript.

Applying accessibility principles with proper ARIA attributes.

Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable CSS.

 Goal

To demonstrate growth beyond static pages by building interactive, user-friendly, and professional web pages that meet real-world development standards.
