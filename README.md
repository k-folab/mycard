Stage 0 â€“ MyCard
A simple and elegant digital card that introduces me by showcasing my hobbies, interests, and dislikes.
Built as part of the HNG Internship Stage 0 task, focusing on clean design, semantic structure, and responsiveness.
This project highlights my ability to translate basic requirements into a visually appealing and functional interface.
It also reflects my attention to detail and my growing passion for building user-centered web experiences.
A solid start to my HNG journey and a foundation for upcoming stages.
